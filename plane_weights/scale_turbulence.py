def scale_turbulence(pilot_reported_turb, plane_weight):
    """
    Scale the pilot-reported turbulence intensity based on aircraft weight.
    
    Intensities range from 0 to 7.
    Weights:
        - 'L' (Light): No change
        - 'M' (Medium): +1
        - 'H' (Heavy): +2
        - 'U' (Unknown): No change 

    Parameters:
        pilot_reported_turb (int): Turbulence intensity (1-7).
        plane_weight (str): Aircraft weight category ('L', 'M', 'H').

    Returns:we
        int: Scaled turbulence intensity.

    Assumptions:
        Note for unknown plane weights, we will leave turb intensity unchanged
        since almost all unknown plane weights are little small unique planes
